            Stephen Edwin King (born September 21, 1947) is an American author of contemporary horror, supernatural fiction, suspense, science fiction,
            and fantasy.</p>
          <p>
            His books have sold more than 350 million copies, many of which have been adapted into feature films, miniseries, television
            shows, and comic books.</p>

            His novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption was the basis for the movie The Shawshank Redemption which is widely

            With 54 novels and over 200 short stories it's very hard to choose a few. And yet as anybody else I have my own favourites.
            These are all-time classics and some stories that just settled into my mind.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the beginning, when I read the first two or three books, I was startled by how easy the author transmitted the
            sense of horror, that we experience while watching movies. I never thought it possible for a book to be so scary.
          </p>
          <p>
            But it is not the horror parts that I like, but rather how masterfully the author describes the most mundane things.
            These parts, when people just live their lives and go through their stories, are just beautiful, like songs.

            <b>The Dead Zone</b> is a supernatural thriller novel by Stephen King published in 1979.
          </p>
          <p>
            It concerns Johnny Smith, who is injured in an accident and remains in a coma for nearly five years.
            When he emerges, he can see horrifying secrets but cannot identify all the details in his "dead zone",
            an area of his brain that suffered permanent damage as the result of his accident.
            Much of the novel is played out against the historical backdrop of the 1970s.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Dead Zone was nominated for the Locus Award in 1980.

            <b>The Shining</b> is a horror novel by American author Stephen King.
            Published in 1977, it is King's third published novel and first hardback bestseller,
            and the success of the book firmly established King as a preeminent author in the horror genre.
          </p>
          <p>
            The setting and characters are influenced by King's personal experiences, including both his visit to The Stanley Hotel in 1974
            and his recovery from alcoholism. The novel was followed by a sequel, Doctor Sleep, published in 2013.
          </p>
          <p>
            The novel was adapted into a 1980 feature film of the same name directed by Stanley Kubrick and co-written with Diane Johnson.

            <b>The Dark Tower</b> is a series of books written by American author Stephen King, which incorporates themes from multiple genres,
            including dark fantasy, science fantasy, horror, and Western. It describes a "gunslinger" and his quest toward a tower, the nature of which is both physical and metaphorical.
          </p>
          <p>
            King has described the series as his magnum opus. In addition to the eight novels of the series proper that comprise 4,250 pages, many of King's other books relate to the story,
            introducing concepts and characters that come into play as the series progresses. A series of prequel comics followed the completion of the novels.
