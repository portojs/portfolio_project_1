            <b>The Dead Zone</b> is a supernatural thriller novel by Stephen King published in 1979.
          </p>
          <p>
            It concerns Johnny Smith, who is injured in an accident and remains in a coma for nearly five years.
            When he emerges, he can see horrifying secrets but cannot identify all the details in his "dead zone",
            an area of his brain that suffered permanent damage as the result of his accident.
            Much of the novel is played out against the historical backdrop of the 1970s.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Dead Zone was nominated for the Locus Award in 1980.

            <b>The Shining</b> is a horror novel by American author Stephen King.
            Published in 1977, it is King's third published novel and first hardback bestseller,
            and the success of the book firmly established King as a preeminent author in the horror genre.
          </p>
          <p>
            The setting and characters are influenced by King's personal experiences, including both his visit to The Stanley Hotel in 1974
            and his recovery from alcoholism. The novel was followed by a sequel, Doctor Sleep, published in 2013.
          </p>
          <p>
            The novel was adapted into a 1980 feature film of the same name directed by Stanley Kubrick and co-written with Diane Johnson.

            <b>The Dark Tower</b> is a series of books written by American author Stephen King, which incorporates themes from multiple genres,
            including dark fantasy, science fantasy, horror, and Western. It describes a "gunslinger" and his quest toward a tower, the nature of which is both physical and metaphorical.
          </p>
          <p>
            King has described the series as his magnum opus. In addition to the eight novels of the series proper that comprise 4,250 pages, many of King's other books relate to the story,
            introducing concepts and characters that come into play as the series progresses. A series of prequel comics followed the completion of the novels.

            <b>Duma Key</b> is a novel by American novelist Stephen King published on January 22, 2008 by Scribner.
            The book reached #1 on the New York Times Best Seller List. It is King's first novel to be set in Florida or Minnesota.
            The dust jacket features holographic lettering.

            Critical reception was generally positive, with some negative criticism being outweighed on the whole by the positive,
            a fact noted by USA Today and declared by King in that article as a byproduct of the fact that
            "a lot of today's reviewers grew up reading my fiction. Most of the old critics who panned anything I wrote are either dead or retired".
